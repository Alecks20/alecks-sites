        <p class="text">Welcome to my own cozy static site hosting server, currently its pretty barebones and everything is manual (somewhat).</p>
        <p class="text">Users request to have their websites git repo cloned onto the server, then it will be exposed under an alecks.site subdomain, custom domains are also available just ask me to configure it.</p>
        <p class="text">Alternatively, if you don't use git or prefer to upload your files manually, I can give you an sftp acc with access to your site folder.</p>
        <p class="text">If you'd like access, send me an email at <b>me@alecks.dev</b> with your sites git repo, desired site name and custom domain (if applicable).</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">🍣 features and limits</h3>
        <p class="text"><b>fair use bandwidth</b> - all users recieve unmetered bandwidth, however service access will be limited if you abuse it.</p>
        <p class="text"><b>automated updates</b> - your git repo is regularly checked every minute to ensure updates are instant.</p>
        <p class="text"><b>free custom domains</b> - as you may have read above, custom domains are available for all users, just create a cname to alecks.site and contact me as it requires some manual configuration (for now).</p>

        <h3 class="subtitle">🍚 service changelog</h3>
        <p class="text"><b>2nd jun 2025</b> - service officially launched</p>
